   		<h2>Returns/Shipping</h2>
   		<p>We love to provide personalized guidance and answer any size-related questions or dazzle you with additional photographs via email. Simply jot us a note in our contact page and we will gladly write back - we simply love to get to know our customers!</p>
   		<p>However, if your new necklace or earrings are not all you hoped they would be, we will gladly facilitate an exchange or provide full refund (less the shipping cost).</p>
   		<h3>If you wish to return, make sure that:</h3> 
         <ol>
         <li>The jewelry is in its original state and has all the tags attached.</li>
         <li>You email us for an authorization code to include with your original receipt and packaging.</li>
         <li>You do this quickly because all exchanges must be postmarked within 14 days from the time of receipt.</li>
         </ol>
         <p>We do not offer credit for return shipping costs or take responsibility for lost merchandise. For that reason to insure the safety of your return, we highly recommend that you insure the items for their full price and use a reliable and traceable carrier such as UPS or Fedex. Once we have received the returned jewelry and it meets our exchange policy, we will happily ship a replacement to you or issue a full refund.</p>
   		<p>All jewelry we carry is carefully examined for defects before getting a stamp of approval for shipping to you. Please read our "Jewelry Condition" policy to understand the quality of our vintage pieces.</p>
   		<h3>Please note:</h3>
   		<p>Goods will only be accepted for return if they are returned within 14 days of delivery, unless we have notified you otherwise.</p>
   		<p>The cost of returning the item to us is your responsibility. Delivery charges are only refundable when goods are damaged en route to you. Please notify us of this unfortunate event right away and include photographs so we can issue an authorization code for your return. After a thorough check of the item, we will ensure you get a refund as well as get compensated for your shipping charges! Please allow 14 working days for a refund to be processed.</p>
   		<h3>Shipping</h3>
   		<p>Currently we ship within the United States only. However, if you reside outside the United States and find a product that you love, please, do not hesitate to contact us. We will deliver to Europe but will have to discuss it on the individual basis due to variants in international shipping rates! Thanks!</p>
