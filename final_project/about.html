   		<h2>What We Are Selling Here</h2>
   		<p>As girls growing up, we all had this wondrous moment of discovering the treasures of our mother's vanity, closet and jewelry bureau. Stilettos seven sizes too big, smeared lipstick and a string of pearls were met with laughter. However looking back at this first attempt at femininity, we still remember how happy it made us feel!</p>
   		<p>For me growing up this nostalgia for unabashed self-expression was transformed into a fascination with costume jewelry and especially the vintage masterpieces created by <em>Kenneth Jay Lane</em>, <em>Lawrence Vrba</em> and <em>Alice Caviness</em>. The idea of opening this store grew out of my shopping dissatisfaction with the poor quality and drag ambiance of most boutiques targeting the niche vintage market. Developing Posh Rx I strived to create a new retail space that emphasized the beauty of things past, their artisan craftsmanship, rich patterns and superior materials. I wanted my vintage finds to dazzle everyone who shares my passion and do so via a coherent and modern website for the headache-free shopping experience! I believe that with mass production, objects have lost their uniqueness and flair. I simply want to go back to tradition and artistic precision and I invite you to join me on this journey!</p>
   		<p>Posh Rx is a retail concept built upon a passionate belief that femininity is a gift to be treasured and playfully explored. Let's take the time to slow down and enjoy the theater of dress up and infinite charm and versatility of accessorizing. Posh Rx longs for the return of seductiveness, mannerisms and, above all, the boldness of creative self-expression!</p>
